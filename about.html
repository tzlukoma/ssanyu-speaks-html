                    <p>I am a teenage entrepreneur, author, and public speaker.</p>

                    <p>In 2018, at 13 years old,
                        I founded <a href="https://brownkidsread.org/">Brown Kids Read</a>, a non-profit organization
                        dedicated to motivating all children, but
                        especially children of color, to read more diverse literature. </p>
                    <p>
                        Since then, I have created an online and pop-up bookstore called The Brown Reads Bookshelf, and
                        host a podcast called <a href="https://brownkidsread.org/the-book-junkie-podcast/">The Book
                            Junkie</a>. I have also presented to corporations including <a
                            href="http://flywire.com">Flywire</a>
                        and <a href="http://jpmorganchase.com">JPMorgan Chase</a> about Teenage entrepreneurship, and
                        Diversity, Equity & Inclusion.
                        In addition, I presented goal-setting workshops for public high school students. Most recently,
                        I wrote a children’s picture book entitled <em><a href="/suubis-sunny-smile.html">Suubi's
                                Sunny Smile</a>.</em>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <em>Subbi's Sunny Smile</em> comprises prominent heritage and
                        dental hygiene themes, but most
                        importantly, has a vital anti-bullying message. I was compelled to write a story
                        featuring Suubi, a main character of color, whose inspiring journey will show young readers that
                        what makes us unique, can be our greatest strength.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        On New Year’s Day, 2021, when I turned 16, I decided that this is the year that I will
                        realize my dream and publish <em>Suubi's Sunny Smile</em>. To accomplish this goal, I used
                        my
                        birthday gifts from family and friends to edit, illustrate, and format the book. I am now
                        looking for ways to use my unique ability to inspire and motivate others, to earn the resources
                        needed
                        to complete this goal.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I am looking for public speaking engagement opportunities to share my passion for diverse
                        literature, to serve as a model that young people can make a difference, and to tell my story
                        of how my love for reading has enhanced my life.
                    </p>
